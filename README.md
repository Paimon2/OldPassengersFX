PassengersFX 1.0.1 (from 2017), prior to maintenance of the project being taken over by X-Plane Addicted.

Emphasis - version 1.0.1. The code here has not been updated since 2017! I was the developer and maintainer of PassengersFX prior to handing over development to Kevan Fitzakerley.

Latest version of PassengersFX: https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/40227-passengersfx-pfx2020/
